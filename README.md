<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a module written in c++  and pythonwhich is an implementation of Peter Burn's Matlab version ISO-12233 slant-edge methodology: sfrmat3.  It is used primarily as a fast and efficient way to deploy camera characterization.

However, this is not meant solely as a standalone package but rather as a teaching tool for image processing standard practices.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Instructions to build the projects depend on which language you choose, in each subfolder will be specfics of how to build.

### Introduction to Modulation Transfer Functions
The main output of this code base is to analyze images taken from a camera of a slant edge to determine the spatial frequency response.  To start one needs to have a few pre-requisites: an image of slant edges and a config file that determines frequency calibration as well as regions of interest that the algorithm uses to crop the individual images.

Generally speaking, when one tests a camera frequency response, it is required to test on-axis as well as off-axis so multiple slant edges will be needed at different field angles. The data directory has an example of a standard image and a config.json file.

The algorithm here is borrowed heavily from Peter Burns' SFRmat3 which stems from ISO-12233 and Alan Boreman's "Modulation Transfer Function in Electro and Optical Systems".  Where the gist is that each slant edge is averaged to an edge spread function (ESF) and used to calculate a point spread function (PSF), then a Fourier Transform is required to calculate a complex spatial frequency response and the modulus of that complex function will give the modulation transfer function (MTF).

By making a few assumptions, this methodology work well.  Firstly, we assume that the system is optical system is linear and that an optical transfer function formalism is applicable.  Although this assumption is not strictly required to complete the calculation, it does help to clarify the representation of the MTF as a quantitative represenation of image quality.  Even though nonlinearities may arise due to abberations in the far off-axis, the MTF is still useful in describing the relative image quality to on-axis.  Secondly, that the ESF acts as an impulse response mechanism that is used to characterize the spatial frequency response is valid.  Similar to mechanical or electrical wavelet testing, there are multiple ways to induce a input-output relation such as swept-sine, impulse or white noise.  It's just that for camera optics testing, the intersection of convinence and accuracy is best with a slant edge impulse response.

However, there are practical complexities that Burns and Boreman treat similarily with regards to the image processing that are implemented within the full algorithm.
